## [0.5] - 2018-03-01
The first release after major refactoring:

### Changed
- Refactored into a proper `heudiconv` Python module
  - `heuristics` is now a `heudiconv.heuristics` submodule
  - you can specify shipped heuristics by name (e.g. `-f reproin`)
    without providing full path to their files
  - you need to use `--files` (not just positional argument(s)) if not
    using `--dicom_dir_templates` or `--subjects` to point to data files
    or directories with input DICOMs
- `Dockerfile` is generated by [neurodocker](https://github.com/kaczmarj/neurodocker)
- Logging verbosity reduced
- Increased leniency with missing DICOM fields
- `dbic_bids` heuristic renamed into reproin
### Added
- [LICENSE](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/LICENSE)
  with Apache 2.0 license for the project
- [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Regression testing](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/tests/test_regression.py) on real data (using datalad)
- A dedicated [ReproIn](https://github.com/repronim/reproin) project
  with details about ReproIn setup/specification and operation using
  `reproin` heuristic shipped with heudiconv
- [utils/test-compare-two-versions.sh](utils/test-compare-two-versions.sh)
  helper to compare conversions with two different versions of heudiconv
### Removed
- Support for converters other than `dcm2niix`, which is now the default.
  Explicitly specify `-c none` to only prepare conversion specification
  files without performing actual conversion
### Fixed
- Compatibility with Nipype 1.0, PyDicom 1.0, and upcoming DataLad 0.10
- Consistency with converted files permissions
- Ensured subject id for BIDS conversions will be BIDS compliant
- Re-add `seqinfo` fields as column names in generated `dicominfo`
- More robust sanity check of the regex reformatted .json file to avoid
  numeric precision issues
- Many other various issues

## [0.4] - 2017-10-15
A usable release to support [DBIC] use-case
### Added
- more testing
### Changes
- Dockerfile updates (added pigz, progressed forward [dcm2niix])
### Fixed
- correct date/time in BIDS `_scans` files
- sort entries in `_scans` by date and then filename

## [0.3] - 2017-07-10
A somewhat working release on the way to support [DBIC] use-case
### Added
- more tests
- groupping of dicoms by series if provided
- many more features and fixes

## [0.2] - 2016-10-20

### Added
